This is a valuation template I have been personally using for sometime now. I have made it presentable and also sharing with everyone using my GIT.
It gives a bird's eye view of the 
1. Return Ratios
2. Valuation Metrics
3. Sequential Quarter Growth
4. Last Two Quarters YoY Growth
5. Cash Flow Growth over 1, 3 and 5 years
6. Retained Earnings Growth over 1, 3 and 5 years
7. Does a DCF on basis Cashflows 
8. Does a DCF on basis Revenues
9. Guestimates the Margin of Safety
10. Gives Historical Trend for Retained Earning per share for 1, 3 and 5 years
11. Gives Historical Trend for Dividend per share for 1, 3 and 5 years
12. Presents the Commmonzise on the P&L and Balance Sheet along with EBITDA and Gross Margins


This is version 1.0
I only plan to modify it and release version 2.0 when I feel I am able to add more value to the existing sheet
